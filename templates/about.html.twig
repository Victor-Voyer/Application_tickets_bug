        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            We are <a href="https://github.com/SZ-Leaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sary</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Victor-Voyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Victor</strong></a>, two full stack developers at
            <a href="https://laplateforme.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>La Plateforme</strong></a>. As part of our learning journey and within the temporary staffing agency
            <a href="https://www.eureka-interim.fr/agences-2/#NouvelleAquitaine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eureka</strong></a>, we are developing a website inspired by <em>Stack Overflow</em>,
            initially designed for our class.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project, proposed by our teacher <a href="https://github.com/Atif-Zourgani" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Atif</strong></a>, aims to foster mutual assistance,
            knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement among students through questions, answers, and
            technical discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the long term, we want to evolve the platform beyond training so that it can
            continue to serve as a reference and collaborative tool for our community.
